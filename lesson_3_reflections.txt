When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Using a remote repository instead of than keeping all your work local is useful 
    when you want to share your repository with one or more people. This is
    especially necessary when coding projects become collaborative with one or
    multiple other people contributing to the project. Rather than send each other
    emails of the entire repo once in a while, and having one person merge all
    the new commits to their own branch, Github allows all collaborators to 
    directly push new commits onto the public branch.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
